    CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.
    Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages.Once you successfully develop a set of selctors and CSS rules, its relatively easy to match a document to those rules.
